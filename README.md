Methodology
1️⃣ Asset Selection & Data Gathering

Selected diversified securities from different sectors.

Pulled historical price data from Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg.

2️⃣ Risk & Return Analysis

Expected Return = Mean historical return.

Risk (Volatility) = Standard deviation of returns.

Correlation & Covariance matrices computed for diversification insights.

3️⃣ Portfolio Optimisation

Efficient Frontier plotted to identify optimal portfolios.

Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) identified for lowest risk.

Tangency Portfolio (Max Sharpe Ratio) computed for optimal risk-adjusted return.

4️⃣ CAPM & Performance Metrics

Calculated Beta, Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Jensen’s Alpha.

Benchmarked portfolios against market index performance.

📈 Key Visuals

📉 Efficient Frontier – Risk-return trade-off curve.

📊 Portfolio Composition – Asset weight allocation chart.

📌 Performance Metrics Table – Sharpe, Treynor, Alpha comparisons.

Key Insights

Diversification works – Reduced unsystematic risk significantly.

Portfolios near the tangency point offer highest risk-adjusted returns.

Some assets appear undervalued per CAPM beta-return expectations.
